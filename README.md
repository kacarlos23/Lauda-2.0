## Requirements

- Node.js
- npm
- Docker and Docker Compose

## Environment

Create a `.env` file in the project root:

```env
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://postgres:postgres@localhost:5434/lauda2"
JWT_SECRET="change-this-secret"
PORT=3000
```

The `.env` file is intentionally ignored by Git.

## Backend Setup

Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Start PostgreSQL:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

Run Prisma migrations:

```bash
npx prisma migrate dev
```

Start the API in development mode:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Build and run the compiled API:

```bash
npm run build
npm start
```

## Mobile Setup

Install mobile dependencies:

```bash
cd mobile
npm install
```

Start Expo:

```bash
npm start
```

Run on a target platform:

```bash
npm run android
npm run ios
npm run web
```

## Git Notes

This repository is configured as a single Git project from the root. The mobile app is included as a regular folder, not as a nested repository or submodule.

Ignored files include local environment variables, dependencies, build output, Expo cache, generated native folders, logs, and local editor/system files.
